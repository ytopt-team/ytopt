Edit the make file by commenting in and out sets of compilers.

Usage examples:

For a computational domain of 25 x 20 x 30 grid points (default is 25 x 25 x 25):
./main -ni 25 -nj 20 -nk 30

For a computational domain of 20 x 20 x 20 grid points, can abbreviate:
./main -n 20

Use one-sided boundary approximation at upper (-osu) and lower (-osl) boundaries
(default is using only the interior approximation):
./main -n 20 -osu -osl
