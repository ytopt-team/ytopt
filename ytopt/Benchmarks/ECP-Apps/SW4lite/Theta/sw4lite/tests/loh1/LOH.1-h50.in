# First we set up a grid with a spacing h (=20,40,50)
# over a domain (X x Y x Z) 30000 x 30000 x 17000.
# It will run from time t=0 to t=9
#
# The material properties are given by the
# block commands. They describe a layer
# on top of a half-space in the z-direction
#
# The solution is recorded at different locations
# and saved in different sac-files  (in the LOH_1 directory)
#
# A single moment point source is used with 
# the time dependency being the Gaussian function
#
