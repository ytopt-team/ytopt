# What is ytopt?
``ytopt`` is a machine-learning-based search software package that consists of sampling a small number of input parameter configurations,
evaluating them, and progressively fitting a surrogate model over the input-output space until exhausting the user-defined time or maximum number of 
evaluations. The package provides two different class of methods: Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning.
The software is designed to operate in the master-worker computational paradigm, where one master node fits 
the surrogate model and generates promising input configurations and worker nodes perform the computationally expensive evaluations and 
return the outputs to the master node.
The asynchronous aspect of the search allows the search to avoid waiting for all the evaluation results before proceeding to the next iteration. As 
soon as an evaluation is finished, the data is used to retrain the surrogate model, which is then used to bias the search toward the 
promising configurations.

# Install instructions
The autotuning framework requires the following components: Ytopt, scikit-optimize, and autotune. 

* We recommend creating isolated Python environments on your local machine using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), for example:

```
conda create --name ytune python=3.7
conda activate ytune
```

* Install [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/pbalapra/scikit-optimize.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/pbalapra/scikit-optimize.git
cd scikit-optimize
pip install -e .
```

* Install [autotune](https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git):
```
git clone -b version1 https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git
cd autotune/
pip install -e . 
```

* Install [ytopt](https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git
cd ytopt/
pip install -e .
```

If you encounter installtion error, install psutil, setproctitle, mpich, mpi4py first as follows:
```
conda install -c conda-forge psutil
conda install -c conda-forge setproctitle
conda install -c conda-forge mpich
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py
pip install -e .
```
# Defining autotuning problem

An example to autotune the OpenMP version of XSBench:

* You can define your search problem such as [ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-omp/xsbench/problem.py](https://github.com/jke513/ytopt/blob/master/ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-omp/xsbench/problem.py) for the following search space:

```
# number of threads
p0= CSH.OrdinalHyperparameter(name='p0', sequence=['4','5','6','7','8'], default_value='8')
#block size for openmp dynamic schedule
p1= CSH.OrdinalHyperparameter(name='p1', sequence=['10','20','40','64','80','100','128','160','200'], default_value='100')
#clang unrolling
#omp parallel
p2= CSH.CategoricalHyperparameter(name='p2', choices=["#pragma omp parallel for", " "], default_value=' ')
cs.add_hyperparameters([p0, p1, p2])
```

* You can define the method to evaluate a point in the search space such as [ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-omp/plopper/plopper.py](https://github.com/jke513/ytopt/blob/master/ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-omp/plopper/plopper.py) for code generation and compiling.

* Note that you can install openmpi openmpi-mpicc openmp for this example:
```
conda install -c conda-forge openmp openmpi openmpi-mpicc
```

An example to autotune the hybrid MPI/OpenMP version of XSBench is given in [ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-mpi-omp/xsbench/](https://github.com/jke513/ytopt/blob/master/ytopt/benchmark/xsbench-mpi-omp/xsbench/).

p2= CSH.CategoricalHyperparameter(name='p2', choices=["#pragma omp parallel for", " "], default_value=' ')

cs.add_hyperparameters([p0, p1, p2])
```

# Running

Bayesian optimization with random forest model:
```
python -m ytopt.search.ambs --evaluator ray --problem ytopt.benchmark.xsbench-omp.xsbench.problem.Problem --max-evals=10 --learner RF
```
* Then, ytopt.log, results.csv, and results.json will be rendered.
