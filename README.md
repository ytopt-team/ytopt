# What is ytopt?



``ytopt`` is a machine learning-based autotuning and hyperparameter optimization software package that uses Bayesian Optimization to find the best input parameter/hyperparameter configurations for a given kernel, miniapp, or application with the best system configurations for a given HPC system.

``ytopt`` accepts the following as input:

  1. A code-evaluation wrapper with tunable parameters as a code mold for performance measurement 
  2. Tunable application parameters (hyperparameters) and tunable system parameters 
  3. The corresponding parameter search space for the tunable parameters

By sampling and evaluating a small number of input configurations, ``ytopt`` gradually builds a surrogate model of the input-output space. This process continues until the user-specified time or the maximum number of evaluations is reached.

``ytopt`` handles both unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, searches asynchronously, and can look-ahead on iterations to more effectively adapt to new evaluations and adjust the search towards promising configurations, leading to a more efficient and faster convergence on the best solutions.

Internally, ``ytopt`` uses a manager-worker computational paradigm, where one node fits the surrogate model and generates new input configurations, and other nodes perform the computationally expensive evaluations and return the results to the manager node. This is implemented in two ways: using [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for ``ytopt/benchmark`` in sequential processing and  using [libensemble](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble) for ``ytopt-libe`` in parallel processing.

Additional documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://ytopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Access ``ytopt-libe`` for the latest examples with new features and development.

# Installation instructions
``ytopt`` requires the following components: ``dh-scikit-optimize``, ``autotune``, and ``ConfigSpace``. When ytopt is being installed, ``ConfigSpace`` and ``LibEnsemble`` are required to be installed automatically.


* We recommend creating isolated Python environments on your local machine usingÂ [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), for example:

```
conda create --name ytune python=3.10
conda activate ytune
```

* Create a directory for ``ytune``:
```
mkdir ytune
cd ytune
```

* Install [dh-scikit-optimize](https://github.com/ytopt-team/scikit-optimize.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/ytopt-team/scikit-optimize.git
cd scikit-optimize
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

* Install [autotune](https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git):
```
git clone -b version1 https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune.git
cd autotune
pip install -e . 
cd ..
```

* Install [ytopt](https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git):
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt.git
cd ytopt
pip install -e .
```

After installing scikit-optimize, autotune, and ytopt successfully, the autotuning framework ytopt is ready to use. Browse the ``ytopt/benchmark`` directory for an extensive collection of old examples, or encourage to access ``ytopt-libe`` for the latest examples with new features.

```
# [Optional] Install [CConfigSpace](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/CCS.git):
    * Prerequisites: ``autotools`` and ``gsl``
        * Ubuntu
          ```
          sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool libgsl-dev
          ```

        * MacOS
          ```
          brew install autoconf automake libtool gsl
          ```
    * Build and Install the library and python bindings:
      the `configure` command can take an optional `--prefix=` parameter to specify a
      different install path than the default one (`/usr/local`). Depending on the
      chosen location you may need elevated previleges to run `make install`.
      ```
      git clone git@github.com:argonne-lcf/CCS.git
      cd CCS
      ./autogen.sh
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ../configure
      make
      make install
      cd ../bindings/python
      pip install parglare==0.12.0
      pip install -e .
      ```
    * Setup environment:
      in order for the python binding to find the CConfigSpace library, the path to
      the library install location (`/usr/local/lib` by default) must be appended
      to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux, while on MacOS the
      `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable serves the same purpose. Alternatively
      the `LIBCCONFIGSPACE_SO_` environment variable can be made to point to the installed
      `libcconfigspace.so` file on Linux or to the installed `libcconfigspace.dylib`
      on MacOS. 

* [Optional] Install Online tuning:
    * Online tuning with transfer learning interface is built on Synthetic Data Vault (SDV):
    * Install [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV.git):
      ```
      cd ytopt
      pip install -e .[online]
      ```
    * For macOS it may need to do: ``pip install -e ".[online]"``  

```

# Basic Usage

``ytopt`` is typically run from the command-line in the following example manner:

``python -m ytopt.search.ambs --evaluator ray --problem problem.Problem --max-evals=10 --learner RF``

Where:
  * The *search* variant is one of ``ambs`` (*Asynchronous Model-Based Search*) or ``async_search`` (run as an MPI process).
  * The *evaluator* is the method of concurrent evaluations, and can be ``ray`` or ``subprocess``.
  * The *problem* is typically an ``autotune.TuningProblem`` instance. Specify the module path and instance name.
  * ``--max-evals`` is the maximum number of evaluations.

Depending on the *search* variant chosen, other command-line options may be provided. For example, the ``ytopt.search.ambs`` search
method above was further customized by specifying the ``RF`` learning strategy.

See the [``autotune`` docs](https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune) for basic information on getting started with creating a ``TuningProblem`` instance.

See the [``ConfigSpace`` docs](https://automl.github.io/ConfigSpace/main/) for guidance on defining input/output parameter spaces for problems.

Otherwise, access the subdirectory ``ytopt-libe`` or [ytopt-libensemble](https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt-libensemble) for the latest examples with new features.
